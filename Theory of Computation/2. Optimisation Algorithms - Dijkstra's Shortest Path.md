Whenever you need to send a message across the internet your ip-router has to determine the best and fastest way to send your message. 

This is where Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm can be used.
Designed to find the shortest path between a start node and every other node in a weighted graph.

The implementation of the algorithm is similar to a breadth first search.
It uses a priority queue as the supporting data structure to keep a record of which vertex to visit next.
It starts by assigning a temporary distance value to each node.
The temporary distance is 0 at the start node, and infinity at every other node.
