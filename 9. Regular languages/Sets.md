Sets formalise the idea of grouping objects together and viewing them as a single entity. It is a form of abstraction.

A set is a well defined collection of objects.

- Objects in the set are members or elements.
- A set is unordered.
- Each member in a set can only occur once.
A set is usually denotated by a capital letter, while a member is denoted by a lower case letter.
ie C = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue} blue is a member of C

## Common Sets

N = set of natural numbers 0, 1, 2..

Z+ = set of positive integers 1, 2, 3..

Z = set of all integers -1, 0, 1..

Q = set of all rational numbers (ie can be expressed as a fraction)

R = set of real numbers.

## Set Membership

∈ Means that it is part of the set.

∉ Means that it isn't.

## Set Operations

A U B is the set of all members in A or B or Both

A N B is the set of all members in A and B

A \\ B is the set of all members in A but not in B

## Subsets

A ⊆ B - A is a subset of B, ie {a,b,c,d} ⊆ the alphabet

A ⊈ B - Not a subset if at least one member of the set is not a member.

A ⊂ B - A proper subset when A is a subset of B but A != B

## Cardinality

The cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements in that set. Normally denoted by |?| where ? is the set.
