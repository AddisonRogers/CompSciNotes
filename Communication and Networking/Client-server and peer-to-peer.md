# Client-server and peer-to-peer

## A Client-server Network
The server is a powerful computer which provides services or resources required by any of the clients.
A client is a computer which requests the services or resources provides by the server.

### Role of the Client
The client sends requests to the server and wait for the reply.

### Role of the Server
The server waits for requests from the clients and responds with the data

### Client-Server Networking
A central server is used to manage security, files, processing tasks. You generally require a specialist IT staff to administer the network.![[Pasted image 20230117113734.png]]


## Peer to Peer Network
A peer to peer network has no central server.
It is generally used for small companies with no need for a central server.



### Summary
| Client Server                                              | Peer to peer                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| User ids, passwords and access levels centrally controlled | Files and programs stored on individual computers     |
| Used in small-large organisations                          | Suitable for a home computer network                  |
| Can be expensive to set up and manage                      | Cheap to set up and maintain                          |
| Backup is centralised and usually automated                | Each computer on the network is a client and a server |
| No access to other users' files                            | Can be used for sharing of music and streams                                                      |

The P2P configuration can also be used for file-sharing websites. In a large network this means that thousands of people rather requesting data between the server and the user it is instead passed between people. P2P config is often used for piracy.
P2P has a few issues including:
- Privacy considerations
- If people stop seeding then that data is lost.

## Cloud Computing
Remote servers run by organisations such as dropbox, microsoft or google drive.
This has the advantages of:
- Software and data files can be held in the cloud.
- Software and data is accessible anywhere in the world.
- The data is automatically backed up so you won't be able to lose it.
- The software and data does not occupy space on the user's hard drive.
