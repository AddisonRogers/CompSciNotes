## Stacks

A stack is similar to a queue however the order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal ie Last in first out (LIFO).

### Call Stacks

A common example of a stack is the call stack which is a system level data structure that provides the mechanism for passing parameters, return addresses and any processor register values to subroutines.

A stack frame contains all the parameters, the return address and the local variables for a single call to a subroutine which has not yet completed.
