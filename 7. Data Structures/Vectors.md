## Abstraction

An abstract data type (ADT) is a logical description of how we view the data and possible operations. We are only concerned with what the data is representing and not how it is constructed. Creating an encapsulation around the data - a form of information hiding.

## Definitions

In mathematics a vector is a list of numbers. The numbers are called its components, elements or entries. The elements of a vector are in some sequence enabling us to associate each element with a sequence number.

A scalar mathematical quantity has magnitude (size)

A vector mathematical quantity has both magnitude (size) and direction. It is always drawn on a graph with an arrow to indicate it's direction.

## Using Vectors

Vectors are used for a variety of things such as vector graphics and computer games.
