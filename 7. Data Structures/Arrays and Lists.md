### Dynamic Vs Static

Static data structures are fixed in size, they cannot grow or shrink. An array is an example of a static data structure.
Dynamic data structures can grow and shrink, allocating and deallocating memory from the heap (an area of memory used for this purpose)

### Arrays and Lists

Arrays are ordered sets of data of the same type grouped together using a single identifier. Arrays can have multiple dimensions.


> [!NOTE] Lists
> Lists are similar to arrays however they are dynamic and can shrink or grow depending on the amount of data in the structure.

### Overflow and Underflow

Overflow - Attempting to push onto a data structure that is full.
Underflow - Attempting to pop from a data structure that is empty.
