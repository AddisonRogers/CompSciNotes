## Types of Numbers

### Natural Numbers

These values are numbers that are used to count items.

### Whole Numbers

These values are positive or negative numbers, also called integers.

### Rational Numbers

Rational numbers include values that can be expressed as fractions or ratios. Decimal or fractional sets.

> [!NOTE] Wait a second
> Rational numbers includes whole numbers but it can also be values with recurring values.

### Irrational Numbers

Some numbers cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction, the decimal values of these numbers are endless.

### Real Numbers

If a number is either rational or irrational it is a real number. A real number can be used for measurement.

### Ordinal Numbers

If the numbers can be used to describe the position of where the values appear then the numbers are ordinal numbers.

## Number Systems

### Binary Number System

The binary number system uses only two digits : 1 and 0, on or off. There is only 2 digits the system uses, therefore it is called Base 2.
| Base Position | 2^7   | 2^6 | 2^5  | 2^4  | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
| ------------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Place Value   | 128   | 64  | 32   | 16   | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| Number        | 1     | 0   | 1    | 1    | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| Digit Value   | 128*1 | 0   | 32*1 | 16*1 | 0   | 4*1 | 2*1 | 1*1    |

### Hexadecimal Number System

The hexadecimal number system uses 16 digits : 0 - F. This is base 16.

| Base Position | 16^2  | 16^1  | 16^0 |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Place Value   | 256   | 16    | 1    |
| Number        | 3     | F     | 5    |
| Digit Value   | 256*3 | 16*15 | 1*5     |


> [!NOTE] Why use hex?
> We use hexadecimal value because it is much easier to read, remember and type in comparison to a string of binary digits. Hex is used for colours, mac addresses, in assembly languages and machine code. It is also very easy to convert to and from binary.
