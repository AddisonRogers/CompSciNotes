## Encapsulate what varies
This is the idea that where there is a variance, then there should be a class for it. This is based on encapsulation and information hiding, so that the properties and methods are appropriate to the real world scenario they reflect.

**Separate the parts that may be subject to change from the parts that will stay the same.**
