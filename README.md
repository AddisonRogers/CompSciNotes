# Notes

Notes for the AQA Computer Science A-Level.
Contributes welcome, just match the rough style please.

If you see a page that may not be up to quality add a #TODO at the end or at where your issue is.

This is made using [Obsidian,](https://obsidian.md) and I highly recommend everyone to use it for the repo to make sense.
