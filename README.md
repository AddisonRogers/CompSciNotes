# Notes

Notes for the AQA Computer Science A-Level.
Contributes welcome, just match the rough style please.

If you see a page that may not be up to quality add a #Remake  at the end or at where your issue is. Or if I am missing content add a #TODO and then the reason why.

This is made using [Obsidian,](https://obsidian.md) and I highly recommend everyone to use it for the repo to make sense.

I am sorry for the messy layout. It is based on the latest spec sheet for the A-Level exams rather than what makes sense.
