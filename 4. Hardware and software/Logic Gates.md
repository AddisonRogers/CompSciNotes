A computer is a collection of transistors and circuits with two states:
- on = 1 = true, where there is a current flowing through the component
- off = 0 = false, where there isn't a current flowing through the component

Boolean logic can be used to compare values to then output a signal. Some conditions used:
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR

## Logic Gate

A logic gate is a series of transistors connected together to give one or more outputs each being based on the input or combination of inputs supplied to it. Each gate can be represented as a diagram, in Boolean logic or as a truth table@

### AND Gate

AND gates uses two inputs to generate one output, the output is only 1 if both inputs are 1.

### OR Gate

### NOT Gate

A NOT gate reverses one input.

### XOR Gate

A XOR gate only outputs a 1 if A and B are the opposite of each other. ie 1, 0 = 1 but 1, 1 = 0.
