## First Class Objects

First class objects (or values) are objects which may:

- Appear in expressions
- Be assigned to a variable
- Be assigned as arguments
- Be returned in function calls
So functions are first class objects themselves.

## Function Application

The process of giving particular inputs to a function is called function application.

## Higher-order Functions

A function is higher-order if it takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result, or does both.

## The Map Function

Map is a higher-order function that takes a list and the function to be applied to the elements in the list as inputs, and returns a list made by applying the function to each element of the old list.

A list is a collection of elements which can be written in square brackets.

## The Filter Function

Filter is another higher-order function which takes a predicate (to define a Boolean condition) and a list. It returns the elements within the list that satisfy the Boolean condition.

## Fold (reduce function)

A fold (or reduce) function reduces a list to a single value, using recursion.
