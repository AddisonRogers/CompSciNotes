An object is an instance of a class. It requires memory for its data and mechanism for linking to the code for its methods. The code is shared with other methods belonging to the same class. Attribute data is not shared. Each object maintains its own state.

## Constructors

A constructor is a special method which in OOP allows us to have some control as to how objects are initialised. It grabs the memory required by the object when it is instantiated. Also used to initialise the attributes of the object it creates. Constructor of a class must have the same name as the class in which it resides. A constructor does not have a return type.

## Initialisation

You can initialise an object's properties directly, during object creation.
