## Encapsulate what Varies

This is the idea that where there is a variance, then there should be a class for it. This is based on encapsulation and information hiding, so that the properties and methods are appropriate to the real world scenario they reflect.

**Separate the parts that may be subject to change from the parts that will stay the same.**

## Abstraction

Presents a view of a real-world object at a high level.

Abstraction is the ability to ignore certain elements of a concept. ie a tube map is not accurate to scale or size and only shows what is necessary for travel. In code it is very similar, the focus is on properties and command operations.

### Abstraction by Generalisation

This is grouping by common characteristics to arrive at a hierarchical relationship of the “is a kind of” type arrived at by removing unnecessary details.

### Problem Abstraction

This is removing details until the problem reduces to one which has already been solved.

### Procedural Abstraction

This is used to keep the actual values separate from the overall design. Ie procedures and passing parameters.

### Functional Abstraction

A function that is used to simplify problems ie sqrt of 3 instead of the actual decimal / how to work it out.

## Encapsulation

Not allowing to look at an object at any other level of detail. Objects can be self contained.

Encapsulation is the grouping of data and methods together within the same object. This promotes the separation of the implementation and the interface.

Encapsulation also promotes information hiding, where the data within an object can only be accessed by the methods within that object. Code outside the class can only access the data through the defined methods. The parts exposed are called the class's interface. The interface should reveal as little as possible about the inner workings of the class.

### Information Hiding

Information hiding is when the data within an object can only be accessed by the methods within that object. Code outside a class can only access the data through the defined methods. The parts exposed are called the class’s interface. The interface generally reveals little as possible about the inner workings of the class.

## Decomposition

Breaking a problem into a number of sub-problems, so that each sub-problem is a problem that can be solved.

## Recursive Algorithms

A recursive algorithm is an algorithm that calls upon itself inside the function.

> [!NOTE] A recursive routine has three essential characteristics:
> - A stopping condition or a ‘base case’ must be included which when met means that the routine will not call itself and start to “unwind”.
> - For input values other than the stopping condition, the routine must call itself.
> - The stopping condition must be reached after a finite number of calls.

Every time a sub routine is called the return address is put on the call stack. Even with a stopping condition, the recursive routine can only be called a limited number of times or the stack will overflow the maximum memory capacity.

### Factorials

$5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1$

5! is the shorthand way of expressing the product of numbers 1 to 5.

Factorials are also an easy example to show recursion:
