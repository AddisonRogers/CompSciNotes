### Access modifiers
Properties of a class are generally declared as private. This is so that they cannot be accessed from outside the class. Methods can be declared as public, protected or private. These are access modifiers. 
Access modifiers control the accessibility of types which includes classes, their methods and properties. 

#### Private
A private member declared within a class module is accessible only within the class in which it is defined.

#### Public
A public member of a class can be accessed from any other class that instantiates that class. This means that public fields and methods are freely accessible from any other class as well as the class in which they are declared.

#### Protected
Applies to class members only. A protected method/attribute is one that is accessible only from within its own class or from a derived class.
