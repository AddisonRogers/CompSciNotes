The class methods so far have been **instance methods**. These are :

- Constructors
- Accessors
- Mutators

But there are more:

- [[#Static]]
- [[#Virtual]]
- [[#Abstract]]

## Static

Static methods are methods attached to a class itself and not any particular instance of the class meaning a static method can be accessed without an object reference as no object is required.

## Virtual

Virtual methods are methods that can be overridden.

## Abstract

This kind of method has no implementation, just a header. It will appear in an abstract Base Class just to ensure completeness. The method will have to be overridden in each of the derived/inherited classes.
